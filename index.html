    <h2>About Blessing Chiminya</h2>
    <img src="imagefounder2.jpg" alt="Blessing Chiminya" class="blessing-image">

      <p>I’m Blessing Chiminya,the owner of Pinnacle Conversion. With five years of experience in online marketing, I began by running a social media agency that helped businesses grow through paid advertising. In 2024, I transitioned into affiliate marketing, focusing on the Market Research vertical.

In 2026, we pivoted to focus exclusively on lead-generation verticals—primarily Home Improvement and Insurance.

At Pinnacle Conversion, my goal is to help businesses acquire high-quality leads and maximize conversions using proven, data-driven strategies. .</p>
